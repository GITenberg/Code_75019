<blockquote class='fs08'>A REVERED TRADITION OF THE SEA MAY BE CONFUSED WITH A
SKUTTLE-BUTT RUMOR&mdash;WHEN STORMS BLOW UP OFF THE PACIFIC
COAST AND TWO CAPTAINS OF THE OLD SCHOOL COME FACE TO
FACE, ONE ON THE BRIDGE OF A COAST GUARD CUTTER AND
THE OTHER IN COMMAND OF A RUM RUNNER</blockquote>

<p class='sb'><span class='upcase'>A month</span> had passed since the
<i>Crayton</i> had first appeared offshore seeking a chance to land her cargo
unobserved. It was an interesting and valuable cargo, but there really was no
secret regarding the identity&mdash;real stuff, bottled in Scotland. Each bottle
bore a label which read:</p>

<blockquote>
Supplied on all the Liners of the P.&nbsp;&&nbsp;O. Coy. continuously since 1874,
numerous other Shipping Companies, H. M. Transports, and to many Clubs and
Officers’ Messes at home and abroad.
</blockquote>

<p>But this cargo was not destined for either P.&nbsp;&&nbsp;O. Liners, His Majesty’s
transports or Officers’ Messes&mdash;not if Captain McNulty could elude the Coast
Guard ships strung along the invisible line designated the twelve mile
limit.</p>

<p>The glass was dropping and McNulty scowled and cursed his luck as the
<i>Chinook</i>, one of Uncle Sam’s newest cutters, steamed past. Old Wold, her
skipper, was on the bridge and he knew all about the <i>Crayton</i> and McNulty. In
addition he was familiar with all of the tricks in the book and could neither
be deceived nor bought. It was his belief that a pitcher could and would come
to the well once too often.</p>

<p>From the <i>Crayton’s</i> crow’s-nest came the lookout’s monotonous voice,
“<i>Chinook</i> two points off the starboard bow, sir!”</p>

<p>McNulty growled a retort and glanced at Pritt who owned the cargo and ship.
“The <i>Chinook</i> is ready to take us as usual, Mr. Pritt.”</p>

<p>Pritt swore with feeling. Then he swore again as the radio operator appeared
with a weather report predicting a bad blow within a few hours. McNulty put to
sea. This was no coast to be caught in a blow. Pritt ventured a suggestion.
“The cutter is riding light and we are loaded. We can stand rougher weather
than the <i>Chinook</i>; why not try to run in after she’s hunted shelter?”</p>

<p>“Not off this coast, sir,” McNulty replied. He sniffed the air, believing
his sense more reliable than a weather report. “A man needs room in bad
weather. If we crashed on a reef&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ship and cargo are insured against perils of the sea,” Pritt
interrupted.</p>

<p>McNulty scowled fiercely. Pritt flushed. McNulty clipped his words. “Let me
remind you, sir, I am a sailor first. There are certain codes a real sailor
never forgets. There’s saving human lives; and there’s sailing your ship
whether she’s a great liner with hundreds of passengers or a fishing schooner.
Never forget that, Mr. Pritt.”</p>


<p class='sb'><span class='upcase'>Pritt</span> watched the coast line slip
over the horizon. Ahead everything was black and the men were making things
secure. Queer people, these sailors, he reflected. He had met many of the old
school. They were all the same, respecting codes time had handed down. Yes, and
stubborn. Old Wold was stubborn in his determination to prevent the <i>Crayton</i>
from landing her cargo. McNulty, though he was none too keen about the job, was
determined to see it through now that he had agreed to Pritt’s proposition.</p>

<p>An hour later the storm was upon them. Great seas crashed over the deck; the
woodwork creaked and groaned as the vessel labored. McNulty paced a
spray-drenched bridge. He was dressed in oilskins and the face peering from
beneath the sou’wester was ruddy and glowing with the joy of battle. The blue
eyes peered into the darkness and saw many things denied the landsmen. The
flesh about the eyes was lined and seamed from many years squinting, for
phantom ships leap unexpectedly from the fog; phantom reefs bare their fangs on
stormy nights and the sailor’s only guess must be the right guess.</p>

<p>With this man on the bridge a sense of security stole over Pritt. He retired
to his bunk, snuggled in the warmth of the blankets and listened to the roar of
the storm and the break of the seas against the riveted walls. The pulsations
of the engine lulled him to sleep.</p>


<p class='sb'><span class='upcase'>It was</span> the change in the engine room
rhythm that awakened him. Sensing the unusual, Pritt dressed hastily. The
<i>Crayton</i> was wallowing in a troubled sea. Sounds that the engine usually
stilled became audible; spray hissed; waves broke and rushed into an inky
night. “What’s the trouble, Captain. Coast Guarder?”</p>

<p>The Coast Guard vessels were a nightmare to Pritt. The storm might have
driven them within the twelve mile limit.</p>

<p>“Vessel in distress. See her? Dead ahead, sir!” The skipper pointed a stubby
finger. Pritt could see nothing, but presently a flare outlined the masts and
shrouds of a small schooner. She was barely making headway. “Full speed ahead,
Mr. Hansen! We’ll speak her!”</p>

<p>The mate executed the order, first repeating it.</p>

<p>When she was alongside the battered craft McNulty’s voice boomed a “On deck
there?”</p>

<p>“Hello!” The answer came from a figure clinging to the schooner’s wheel. The
wind carried half the man’s words away. Pritt caught,
“&mdash;engineer&mdash;foot&mdash;in&mdash;’chinery&mdash;crushed&mdash;aid?”</p>

<p>“Engineer crushed his foot in the machinery,” McNulty explained. “Needs
aid!” He turned to the mate. “Mr. Hansen we’ll take him aboard.”</p>

<p>McNulty did not say they would attempt to take him aboard the <i>Crayton</i>. He
said they would take him. It was evident the schooner’s small crew had prepared
for this. They carried a limp figure to a contrivance of wood and canvas
secured to a midships deckhouse and lashed it. With few words being passed the
two crews worked in unison.</p>

<p>Pritt gripped the bridge rail and held his breath as one of the <i>Crayton’s</i>
cargo booms swung over the schooner’s deck. The steel block swung dangerously,
caught and tore free some light gear on the smaller craft, then came banging
against the steamer’s side. With infinite patience they maneuvered the restless
craft and bided their time&mdash;knowing that in the end it would come.</p>


<p class='sb'><span class='upcase'>Deft</span> hands finally caught the block
and hooked it into a network of lines as the schooner was on the crest of a
wave. The next instant she had dropped beneath the improvised stretcher and the
injured man swung into space. The sea leaped up furiously, as if denied its
prey, then dropped sullenly away. The <i>Crayton’s</i> hoists whined, then slackened
away on the falls as the stretcher came clear of the side. A dozen men rushed
forward to stop the swinging burden. It knocked them down and crashed against
steel walls of the deck houses. Pritt could feel his own flesh wince as the
injured man’s bones snapped from the impact. The falls slacked away suddenly
and their burden stopped soddenly in the water surging on the deck. Brief as
was the pause it was sufficient for eager hands to snatch the man from the
stretcher and carry him into a cabin. Drenched and battered, the men withdrew.
The captain and the steward examined the victim.</p>

<p>The skipper’s thick fingers explored his ribs which had taken much of the
impact. “Some broken,” he announced. “Arm broken, too! He’s unconscious, but
coming ’round. Now for the foot!” The swollen, pulpy mass might have been a
foot at one time, but now&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;Pritt shuddered. It looked as if it had been fed
into a rock crusher.</p>

<p>The skipper scribbled a brief message:</p>

<blockquote>
<div>Captain Wold,<br>
U.S.C.G. Chinook. Have taken badly injured man from Schooner,
<i>Vivian Gill</i>. Leg amputation necessary. Radio position.</div>
<div style='text-align:right'>McNulty, Crayton.</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Pritt read the message and licked his lips, suddenly grown dry. “Are you
taking him inside the twelve mile limit, Captain?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir! God was with us in getting him aboard. We could never
transfer him again&mdash;and be lucky.”</p>

<p>“We might!” Pritt’s voice was hoarse. “If we’re caught inside the twelve
mile limit&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;God, Captain, and you’re going right into the cove where the
<i>Chinook’s</i> anchored. It means&mdash;ship and cargo.”</p>

<p>“He can’t be transferred again at sea,” McNulty answered grimly.</p>

<p>“Try it!”</p>

<p>“We can’t trifle with a dying man.”</p>

<p>“If the cutter would meet us he’d get attention that much sooner. Try
it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“I order you to do it, sir!” The words came thickly. Pritt’s face was ashen.
A jury might take into consideration the circumstance and free them, but it
would never return ship and cargo&mdash;it could not. “I order you to at least
attempt it, sir!”</p>

<p>“You order?” McNulty’s eyes glittered.</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>“You’ve forgotten the law of the sea, sir. I am the only man who gives
orders on this ship. I am responsible.”</p>

<p>“When we touch port, sir&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes, when we do,” McNulty rasped anticipating his words. “My chest is
always packed!” he added.</p>


<p class='sb'><span class='upcase'>Presently</span> the steward returned from
the radio shack. The <i>Chinook</i> was lying in Salmon Cove.</p>

<p>Salmon Cove!</p>

<p>What queer tricks fate played at times. This was the point selected to land
their cargo.</p>

<p>With the storm blowing her shoreward and the engines turning over at full
speed the <i>Crayton</i> was breaking her best previous record. McNulty was grim as
he crossed the twelve mile limit. In time the grim walls of the coast loomed
ahead. Even in the darkness the line of surf stood out sharply and white.
Somewhere there was a break. They felt the ground swell now&mdash;the lift and fall
was different.</p>

<p>“Peril of the sea!” muttered Pritt. “I hope we strike. The Coast Guarder is
there to rescue us. I hope we strike!”</p>

<p>A white finger of light suddenly pointed skyward, giving the location of the
cove. The <i>Crayton</i> slackened speed, then McNulty growled, “Hard over!”</p>

<p>“Hard over, sir!”</p>

<p>The steamer seemed to slip into the trough of the sea then slide behind
white water. The tossing ceased!</p>

<p>As they came slowly alongside the cutter, her rails were lined with alert
seamen. The cutter’s surgeon leaped aboard and disappeared below, followed by a
hospital steward.</p>


<p class='sb'><span class='upcase'>Wold</span> paced his own bridge, pausing
frequently to take in the details of the <i>Crayton</i>. She rode very low in the
water. “Nasty outside, Captain?” he observed.</p>

<p>“Very, Captain,” McNulty answered. “The man’s bad hurt, I should say. The
<i>Vivian Gill</i> has a gas engine to keep her moving, like so many fishing
schooners. He got his foot into the machinery some way. Then in getting him
aboard we smashed him some more, sir!”</p>

<p>“It don’t seem possible you could have taken him aboard, Captain, in that
blow!” What a cargo the <i>Crayton</i> must have to make her ride so low. Only
machinery or bottled goods could make a steamer ride like that. So this was the
<i>Crayton</i>, the rum runner, a thorn in the Coast Guard’s side? Wold looked at
McNulty’s stubby hands, resting on the bridge rail. The rain was whipping the
flesh into a ruddy glow. Short, thick hands&mdash;the hands of a man who had learned
his ground work in sail. They were hands similar to Wold’s. Scars from rope
burns; scars from fistfights. The present generation of sailors was good
enough, but it was the old sailing vessels that taught men the sea and its
codes. Such codes were made by time; not by men who wrote them on paper and
called them laws. Men got around laws through technicalities, but seamen
followed the spirit of the code.</p>

<p>They were bringing a stretcher from the <i>Crayton</i>. A blanketed figure lay
silent, but the chest rose and fell&mdash;like the sea beyond the reef. Sometimes it
was quick, again it was slow, doubtful, as if the blow was almost over. The
blanket blew back, disclosing a white face coated with the grease of the engine
room.</p>

<p>The surgeon looked up briefly. “He’ll live, I think, but that foot will have
to come off. Yes, he’ll live. The sea breeds men.”</p>


<p class='sb'><span class='upcase'>Two</span> of the <i>Crayton’s</i> crew leaped
back to the deck of their own vessel as seamen took their places at the
stretcher. The grim Coast Guard skipper cleared his throat. “Cast off the
<i>Crayton’s</i> lines for’d and aft,” he shouted. He looked sharply at McNulty. “I
suppose you’ll be proceeding, sir, the storm has about blown out.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be proceeding, Captain Wold,” McNulty answered.</p>

<p>As the <i>Crayton</i> swung about and steamed slowly seaward a sailor who had
been aboard the steamer hurried up to the skipper. He was a young man and did
not understand all of the traditions of the sea and the unwritten codes between
masters. “When I was aboard, sir, I could smell whisky&mdash;Scotch whisky, sir.
Some of her cargo must have broken in the storm.”</p>

<p>Captain Wold looked the youth squarely in the eye. “Youthful imagine, lad,
youthful imagination,” he said as though giving an order. “There’s a
skuttle-butt rumor that she’s a rum-runner, but I sniffed and didn’t smell a
damned thing.”</p>
